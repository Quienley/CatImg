# CatImg
Android application for editing images.

CatImg - it's not finished my pet-project and it has mistakes and unfinished functions.

Finished:
- Import photo from Gallery or making photo with phone camera.
- Applying filters.
- Cropping image.
- Transforming (rotating by a clockwise and anticlockwise, horizontal and vertical flipping).
- Undo/Redo function.
- Export to device with custom name.
- Option switch dark/light theme with saving user preferences.
- Sharing function to messangers.

Unfinished:
- Some filters do not work as well as they can and they need for selecting bound values.

Used technologies:
- **Jetpack Compose** - UI.
- **GPUImage** — applying filters.
